Answer 1. -
	The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings and returns that array.It does not change the original string

Answer 2. - 
		1. For Loop-
			for(i=0;i<length;i++)
			
			You can use break and continue statements
		
		2. prototype.forEach -
			array.forEach(function(item,index){})
			
			cannot use break and continue works well with associative arrays
		
		3. map()-
			arr2 = arr1.map(function);

			it create a new array by performing a function on each array element and does not change the original array

		4. filter()-
			arr1 = arr2.filter(function);

			it creates a new array with array elements that return true for the function

		5. reduce()-
			arr1 = arrr2.reduce(function);

			it runs a function on each array element to produce a single value. it works from left-right

		6. every()-
			arr1 = arr2.every(function);

			it checks if all the values in the array return true for the function

		7. some()-
			arr1 = arr2.some(function);

			it checks if some of the values in the array return true for the function

		8. indexOf()-
			idx = arr1.indexOf("element");

			searches for the element in the array and returns its index.

		9. find()-
			first = arr1.find(function);

			returns the value of the first element in the array that returns true for the function

Answer 3-
		The shift() method removes the first element from the array and returns the removed item and changes the original array.

		arr.shift();

Answer 4-
		The unshift() method is used to add element to the first position and returns the new length of the array

		arr.unshift();

Answer 5-
		map() returns a new array and forEach return nothing undefined. because of this you can chain map() with filter or other functions but not with forEach().
		Both functions dont change the array but in the callback map() use a new array while forEach() uses the same array.
